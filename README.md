# Arch Config
My arch linux configuration files

## Zsh Congiguration
Clone the zgenom (continuation of zgen):

	git clone https://github.com/jandamm/zgenom.git "${HOME/.zgenom}"

Copy .zshrc and restart terminal.
## Future plans
There also would be instructions for install and some .sh executables in order to make process faster and easier
